FGUK's EADS Mako/Heat
======================

![FGUK Image](http://www.fguk.eu/images/jdownloads/screenshots/fgfs-screen-0552.png)

Mako is an advanced trainer and light combat aircraft developed at the EADS Military Aircraft facility based in Munchen, Germany. EADS was joined in November 1999 by the air force and air defence force of the United Arab Emirates as a full partner in the program. The definition phase of the aircraft development programme is complete, but the UAE has withdrawn from the project. No decision on production of the aircraft has been taken and there has been no confirmation of the first flight, which was scheduled for 2009. The program is considered cancelled.

This is a continuation of the Mako that was introduced to Flightgear a couple of years ago.
